# About this repo
This is a React multi-page website practice learned from the React Router official website and a YouTube Channel @briandesign, then customize some parts as what I want.<br>
It is also a website deployment test for the React App on my GitHub page.<br>
This will be a temporary repository, and it'll be removed in the near future.

## React Router
I am using RouterProvider, which is the latest version of React Router officially recommended.

## Map
The map that you can find on this website, one of the cards on the Home page, uses the Leaflet library on React recording and demonstrating the affordable housing in Madison, WI which is a casual research my friends and I are doing. We were trying to use GIS knowledge to integrate the housing information and their address.

## Other Design of the page
The CSS, video, and background pictures were taken from the YouTuber's open-sourced Github Repository. They will also be changed in the near future.
