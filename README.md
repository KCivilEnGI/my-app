# About this repo
This is a React multi-page website practice and a website deployment test for the React App on my GitHub page.<br>
This is a demonstration of web design.

## React Router
I am using RouterProvider, which is the latest version of React Router officially recommended.

## Map
The map that you can find on this website, one of the cards on the Home page, uses the Leaflet library on React recording and showing the affordable housing in Madison, WI which is a casual research my friends and I are doing. We were trying to use GIS knowledge to integrate the housing information and their address.
